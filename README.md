# TransitionSimulationSoftware

The system is a simulation software for the electrification of STM Route 211 in which we can configure the requirements that are necessary to implement the technology to see and make changes on the route. This system gives the suggested results according to inputs given for the configuration of the buses and route with charging schedules.<br>

This system provides the information on buses, location of chargers at each terminus, optimal battery size according to charger specification, and prices through selecting the optimal charging models from the manufacturing company. In addition, this system also shows the charging schedule of the buses and can be seen on the webpage.
